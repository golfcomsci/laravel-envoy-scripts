# My Laravel Envoy Scripts

Here I have compiled my Laravel Envoy scripts to deploy different projects.

Simply add the variables from the .env.example file to the project .env file and attach the Envoy.blade.php file that you want to use

To see more information about deploy options please visit these links:
* [Single Deploy](./wiki/single-deploy.md)
* [Zero Downtime Deploy](./wiki/zero-downtime-deploy.md)

In addition, you can consult the Laravel Envoy documentation [here](https://laravel.com/docs/envoy).

Feel free to make contributions to these scripts. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜„
